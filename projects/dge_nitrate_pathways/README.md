# PROJECT: RNA-seq Analysis of ABF2 and ABF3 in Arabidopsis thaliana

My idea of this project was to gain hands-on experience in analysing an rna-seq experiment with treatments and control groups from scratch. I wanted to understand the preprocessing steps in RNA-seq analysis, since we havent done that in detail at university. There we mainly focused on the DGE analysis itself and theoretical background and mathematical derivations. Furthermore, after some time processing the data, I realized the difficulty of just running tools manually for each experiment, hence I discovered Snakemake and learnt this on the fly.  

*Goals*:
- Learn preprocessing steps of for rna-seq experiments
- Apply DGE analysis pipeline to new data
- Start builing a reusable codebase for bioinformatics data analysis (integrating uni code snips from lectures/exercises)
- Adapt to Snakemake
