# My Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! Here are some of my projects:

## RNA-seq Analysis Projects

- [DGE from Scratch](https://github.com/Wildapfel/dge_from_scratch)  
  Analysis of differential gene expression from raw RNA-seq data, including workflow scripts and results.

- [Another Project](https://github.com/Wildapfel/analysis_project2)  
  Description of another analysis project with workflows and summary results.
